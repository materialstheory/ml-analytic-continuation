0.2   # clim1: in (0, 1), symmetric bound of normalized spectral range, beyond which no high weight peaks

0.8   # clim3: in (0, 1), symmetric bound of normalized psectral range, beyond which no peak center
0.015 # sigma_c_lower: sampling range for standard deviation of a single Gaussian peak centered within clim1
0.1   # sigma_c_upper: sampling range for standard deviation of a single Gaussian peak centered within clim1
0.06  # sigma_o_lower: ***, beyond clim1
0.3   # sigma_o_upper: ***, beyond clim1
5e-4  # delta: vanishing threshold at boundary
0.5   # cr1: lower bound of sampling range for weight of a single Gaussian peak centered within clim2
1     # cr2: upper bound of sampling range for weight of a single Gaussian peak centered within clim2
0     # cr3: lower bound of sampling range for weight of a single Gaussian peak centered beyond clim2
0.6   # cr4: upper bound of sampling range for weight of a single Gaussian peak centered beyond clim2
1e-2  # cr_thr: the vanishing criteria is hard to satisfy, we shrink the weight of most problematic peak, until it reaches cr_thr, then we reduce the spread until it is out of the sampling range, then remove it.
1e-6  # delta_smooth: integral of the second derivative must be limited
