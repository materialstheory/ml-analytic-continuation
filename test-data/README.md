* A_omega_test.npy: 9 special spectral functions. 

  * 0 - 7: demonstrated at special_test_Aw.ipynb. Some of these appear in Figure 7 (a) - (f).
  * The last one: from realistic FTPS calculation (c.f. Figure 8 in our paper)

* Gl_test.npy: the Legendre coefficients of imaginary time Greenâ€™s function corresponds to A_omega_test.npy

* SVO_beta*.npy: QMC measurements for the system in Figure 8 at $\beta = 20, 10$ and $2$.

* SVO_CTQMC_50_f_up.npy: QMC measurements for the system in Figure 8 at $\beta = 40$.
