# Machine-learning approach for the DMFT analytic continuation

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/485062333.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/485062333)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for performing the quantum many-body
analytic continuation with a machine learning approach.
It uses a multi-level residual network to continue the DMFT Green's function to
the spectral function as presented in the accompanying paper.

The main functionality of predicting spectral functions with their uncertainty
can be easily run in the demo notebook
`model/AnalyticContinuation.ipynb`: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/materialstheory/ml-analytic-continuation/blob/main/model/AnalyticContinuation.ipynb)

Written by Rong Zhang

from the Materials Theory Group at ETH Zurich.

## Content of the repository

* `kernel/`: generates the matrix for the forward transform, eqn (1) from the paper
* `data/`: artificially generated spectral functions, used as the training set.
* `test-data/`: selection of spectral functions or imaginary axis Greenâ€™s functions
for demonstration
* `model/`: pre-trained neural network models and the script to train a model on
a different data set. Training requires the content of `kernel/` and `data/`,
whereas the pre-trained model can be run directly on the data from `test-data/`
